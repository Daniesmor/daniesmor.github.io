I am a young Research Assistant at Northeastern University in Boston, actively engaged in an exciting computational thinking project. At just 20 years old, I am dedicated to exploring and advancing the intersection of telecommunications engineering and computer science. Currently pursuing a degree in Telecommunications Engineering at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain, I have developed a strong foundation in information and communication technologies.

My professional interests lie in operating systems, open source software development, and artificial intelligence. I firmly believe in the importance of contributing to the open source community to foster collaboration and innovation. As an aspiring researcher, I aim to continue pushing the boundaries of technology, always seeking creative ways to apply my knowledge to address real-world challenges and enhance people's lives through technology.
